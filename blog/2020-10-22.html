			<div class="blog-content">
			At last, our paper, lead by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sarah_Trubovitz">Sarah Trubovitz</a>, came out today in <a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18879-7"><i>Nature Communications</i></a> ! Sarah came to visit us in Berlin twice in 2017 to learn/figure out with us the taxonomy of Neogene radiolarians from the equatorial Pacific. We had an inkling that the actual amount of species in that region/timeframe would be way higher that what was published but I must admit we did't expect that much: she found 990 species just in the last 10 million years of a single site!
			<p>Later, Dave, Paula and her got the idea to compare the species richness and the species content of her work with the Southern Ocean dataset that <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1666/12016">I counted during my thesis</a>, eons ago, and figure out if the extinction event I saw was global, regional or in fact just a migration out of the Antarctic circle, i. e. range shrinking due to the global cooling of the late Miocene (find out more about it by reading the <a href="https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en/press/press-releases/largest-biome-earth-peril">press release</a>... or naturally the paper itself). I didn't have that much time to spent contributing to the writing itself but as the concept was to directly compare the species ranges in both our datasets, I was naturally involved, in particular to match her species concepts with mine. It was quite the nice surprise to see some of the species I described in the Southern Ocean based on a few specimens popping up in the equatorial Pacific!</p>

			<p class="caption"><i>Lithomelissa</i>? <i>kozoi</i> and <i>Clathrocorys sugyiamai</i> (both described in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/jmpaleo2011-025">Renaudie &amp; Lazarus 2013</a>) were among the species also found in the Equatorial Pacific.</p>

			<p>Despite the fact that radiolarians from these two regions are basically studied since close to 200 years, it might surprise some to know that <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4014322">Sarah's dataset and mine</a> are, to date, the only two datasets that <i>tried</i> to actually record exhaustively the full diversity of those faunas! In part because radiolarian are so insanely diverse, but also simply because studying biodiversity was/is not a (fundable) goal of micropaleontology.</p>
			<p>Later during reviews, I also contributed a little piece of statistical analysis that I am actually quite proud of – despite it being a very, very small part of the whole paper naturally :) It uses a nice trick I learned on <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/">CrossValidated</a> (sadly I can't seem to find the post itself back) to test the significance of an event in a time serie: building an AR model for the time serie, and adding as explaining variable to the model a categorical variable stating whether the data points belong to the interval before or after the event, and then test if that variable explains a significant proportion of the variance (using a Wald test). It's fairly simple but it nicely goes around the limitation a t-test would have (as the data in a timeseries would most likely not be independent).</p>
			<p>Sarah also wrote a <a href="https://natureecoevocommunity.nature.com/posts/marine-plankton-show-threshold-extinction-response-to-neogene-climate-change">"Behind The Paper"</a> story that you will find on the <a href="https://natureecoevocommunity.nature.com/">Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution Community blog</a>.</p>
