			<div class="blog-content">
				This week was the annual meeting of <a href="http://tmsoc.org/">The Micropalaeontological Society</a>, in fact it doubled as its 50th anniversary. Of course given the current <s>nightmare</s> circumstances, it happened online and I must say that of all the many, many, MANY meetings and conferences I attended online this year, this might have been one of the most well done, together with the <a href="https://www.egu2020.eu/">EGU online meeting</a> which was really cool and original as it was really free-form, whereas TMS did manage to stick successfully to the classic talks + posters setting. 

				<p>Our students had <a href="https://www.tmsoc.org/conf2020/postergallery.php">two posters</a> there <a href="http://ehrenberglab.github.io/pages/mopga.html">on our current project</a> and got interesting comments/questions (in part as comments on the poster page which was a simple but nifty solution).</p>

				<p>The <a href="https://www.tmsoc.org/conf2020/programme.php">talks</a>, and in particular the keynote talks, were (more than usual) brilliant I must say. It's nice to see micropaleontology finally starting to live up to its potential. Some random thoughts/comments on the talks:
				<ul><li>Mixotrophs are in, this year! Two of the keynote talks revolved more or less around mixotrophy (one by Samantha Gibbs on <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/44/eabc9123">K/Pg nannofossils</a>, one by Celli Hull on a more general point of consideration vis-à-vis questions around planktonic protists and carbon pump). More generally people really moved from considering microfossils as piece of rocks useful to date things to actually considering them for the complex eukaryots they were/are. It helps that molecular biologists started working hand in hand with micropaleontologists in the last decade.</li>
				<li>Radiolarian taxonomy is going through a massive transformation (which might end up with us having to throw away half of the <span class="tooltip">Haeckelian genera names<span class="tooltiptext">good riddance!</span></span> in particular) and I for one cannot be happier.</li>
				<li>People really finally embrace databases and online taxonomical catalog, which is a win for everyone.</li>
				</ul></p>

				<p>Together with our colleagues at the GFZ in Potsdam, we are thinking about putting on a bid to host next year's meeting in Berlin (<span class="tooltip">or, you know, online, if needed<span class="tooltiptext">Hat tip to all the people out there acting as if this was over and thanks to whom this nightmare is gonna last for the next 2 to 5 years! If it's OK with you I would like to be able to go see my family again.</span></span>). We'll see how it goes!</p>
