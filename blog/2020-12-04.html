				Days 3 and 4 of the Advent of Code were still relatively trivial to solve. Day 3 was just playing with coordinates on a 2D discrete map while day 4 entailed more adventures in input parsing :)

				<p>This time the input was fairly randomly organised. Each set of data was on a random number of lines but separated from the next one by an empty line, and each set was composed of values in the form <code class="inline">key:value</code> and separated from the others by a space. I'm pretty sure it could have been entirely sparsed by regex but I was <span class="tooltip">feeling lazy<span class="tooltiptext">having woken up way earlier than usual</span></span>, so I used instead the standard tools (<code class="inline">scan, readLines, strsplit</code>) to create a list of named vectors. Named vectors are frankly rarely used nowadays in R but, maybe it is because I have been programming a lot in python in the last few years, I like to use them as they are R equivalent to python's dictionaries.</p>

<pre><code class="r">input &lt;- readLines("input04.txt")
input[input==""]&lt;-"\n" #First, replace the blank lines separating entries with a newline symbol
passports &lt;- gsub("^ | $","",scan(text=paste(input,collapse=" "),what="",sep="\n")) #collapse all together so that the only newlines are the one separating entries, and reads it in again (plus clean the trailing whitespaces).
pass &lt;- list() #Yes, I know, a loop, yawn.
for(i in seq_along(passports)){
  step &lt;- do.call(rbind,strsplit(scan(text=passports[i],what="",sep=" "),":")) #Separate by spaces, then by colons
  pass[[i]]&lt;-step[,2] #keep the value
  names(pass[[i]])&lt;-step[,1] #and use the key as name
  }</code></pre>

				<p>Once this is done, figuring out the rest of the challenge was fairly trivial. The first part for instance was a one-liner:</p>

<pre><code class="R">#Count the number of passports having all the required fields:
sum(sapply(pass,function(x)all(c("byr","iyr","eyr","hgt","hcl","ecl","pid")%in%names(x))))</code></pre>

				<p>In culinary news, I made a quince pie the other day, "american-style". It wasn't that much of a success, so instead here's a recipe for my best quince-based dessert: my quince cheesecake. I have several variations on that theme but here is the one I made in October 2019 for <a href="https://volkanozen.github.io/">our student's</a> birthday.</p>
				<p>For the crunchy base: broken down biscuits, with butter and a bit of sugar (the biscuits are usually too sweet to begin with), as usual. Then a layer of quince compote (i. e. quinces cooked in a water and a tiny bit of sugar until they are mashed), and then the 'cheese' matrix: 4 eggs, a pot of crême fraîche, some mascarpone and some Rahmjoghurt (in France I would have used Faisselles and/or Petits-Suisses), with sugar (including vanillin sugar). Cooked 45min at around 180&deg;.</p>
