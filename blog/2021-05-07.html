			<p class="blog-content">
Our paper, lead by Michael Buchwitz and Maren Jansen, came out today in <i><a href="http://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.674779">Frontiers in Ecology &amp; Evolution</a></i>, in the context of a special issue on the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/14947/origin-and-early-evolution-of-amniotes#articles">Origin and Early Evolution of Amniotes</a>. This is a study I have been contributing to since 2018 (if I remember correctly), so I am glad to see it finally published. The idea of the paper was to use a fairly impressive database of measurements on early tetrapod trackways, and current hypotheses on track-trackmaker relationships, to test some of those hypotheses and characterize the mode of locomotion of the last common ancestors of amniotes. As it is quite outside of my usual expertise I am not here going to delve into the details of the study, given I was, after all, involved only as the number guy.
<p>I don't have a lot of opportunities to work with phylogenies in my own line of work, though my training in Paris was very heavily phologenetically-oriented, so it was fun to finaly make use of it.</p>
<p>One particular thing I did for this paper was to try taking into account track polymorphism into the ancestral state reconstruction, given the data we used had, for some species, a large amount of specimens measured, and the distribution of the measurements showed quite a spread (ranging from juveniles to adult forms) and the occasional bimodal set-up. The idea I had to account for this was simply to bootstrap these data, meaning that instead of simply using the mean measurement, or median measurement, for each ichnospecies, I picked a single species randomly representing each species, and reiterated the operation a large amount of time. Here the code in R (full code for the entire study is available <a href="https://github.com/plannapus/tracks_asr/">here</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="r">#Bootstrap based on polymorphism
n_trials &lt;- 1e4
n_char &lt;- length(all_char) #all_char contains the list of characters for which we want to run the ASR
# This is fairly time consuming so to make things smoother I used doSNOW to parallelize it.
# The following 7 lines are only there to set it up.
library(doSNOW)
cl &lt;- parallel::makeCluster(2)
registerDoSNOW(cl)
pb &lt;- txtProgressBar(max = n_trials, style = 3)
progress &lt;- function(n) setTxtProgressBar(pb, n)
opts &lt;- list(progress = progress)
set.seed(20180822)
aas &lt;- foreach(i = seq_len(n_trials), .options.snow = opts) %dopar% {
    R &lt;- list() # will contain the results of the 1e4 x n_char x n_tree ASR.
    for(j in 1:n_char){
      R[[j]]&lt;-list()
      # Pick a random specimen for each run and get the value for the specific measurement.
			# First get the list of specimens for which that particular character was measured:
      sp &lt;- dat$specimens[!is.na(dat$specimens[,colnames(dat$specimens)==all_char[j]]),]
			# Then select randomly a single specimen for each ichnospecies:
      specimen_set &lt;- sapply(split(sp$`No Specimen`,sp$`No Species`),function(x)ifelse(length(x)>1,sample(x,1),x))
			# Then pick its corresponding measurement:
      values &lt;- sapply(specimen_set,function(x)sp[sp$`No Specimen`==x,colnames(sp)==all_char[j]])
			# We tried several phylogenetic hypotheses here
      for(k in 1:n_tree){
				 # Maximum likelihood ASR
        R[[j]][[k]] &lt;- ape::reconstruct(values,dat$trees[[k]],method="ML")
      }
    }
    R
  }

<p>It gives a nice idea of the incertitude linked to the set of specimens measured that is introduced by ASR.</p>

<p>Anyway, the paper is naturally about way more than just this (in fact it is a very minor point of that paper) but I thought it was a cool solution to that particular issue.</p>
