		A (very) short word on my current projects:
		<ul class="current">
			<li class="current"><b>Diatoms, radiolarians and the Cenozoic carbon and silicon cycles (DFG RE3470/3-1)</b>:<br/>
			The goal of this project is to estimate the mass of siliceous microfossils that deposited since the middle Eocene in the world's sediments, in order to constrain the Cenozoic fluctuations in the volume of the marine silicon cycle, and to test quantitatively the hypothesis according to which the Cenozoic expansion of diatoms impacted the global carbon cycle on a geological timescale.
			</li>
			<li class="current"><b>nsb_adp_wx.py and NSB age model quality</b>:<br/>
			As a companion to the <a href="http://nsb-mfn-berlin.de">Neptune database (NSB)</a>, I am developing an interactive <a href="https://github.com/plannapus/nsb_adp_wx">software</a> allowing the user to check the database's age models and how they were built, to modify them, to create new ones, etc.<br/><br/>
			<div><img class="current" src="static/nsb_adp.png" alt="Screenshot of the software in use" width="800"><p class="caption">Screenshot of nsb_adp_wx in use.</p></div>
			We are currently in the process of testing the quality of the age models in NSB: <a href="https://github.com/plannapus/nsb_adp_wx">nsb_adp_wx</a> is already an invaluable tool for us to explore alternative age models to replace those of poor quality.<br/>
			The original software was written in True Basic by David Lazarus (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Lazarus3/publication/235781729_Age_depth_plot_and_age_maker_Age_modeling_of_stratigraphic_sections_on_the_Macintosh_series_of_computers">Lazarus, 1992</a>). During the Chronos project era, a Java version was written by Geoffrey Bohling (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/GES00009.1">Bohling 2005</a>). The current python implementation was first written by Pat Diver, while I ported it to wxPython and extended its functionalities.<br/>
			Furthermore, on the subject of NSB, I am also currently writing a manuscript summarizing the current state of the database, the changes made to it since I started participating in its development and the rationale for those changes, as well as the steps taken to ensure the quality of the data present in the database.
			</li>
			<li class="current"><b>Testing the vital effect in silicon isotopes measured on Late Eocene radiolarians</b> (a collaboration with G. Fontorbe, P. Frings and D. Conley from the University of Lund):<br/>
			The idea is to first check the validity of the $\delta^{30}\mathrm{Si}$ radiolarian proxy and, second, to test if each species $\delta^{30}\mathrm{Si}$ record vary according to its living depth (which will allow us not only to estimate the living depth of many species for which this is unknown but also to reconstruct the past marine silicon cycle in 3D).

			</li>
			<li class="current"><b>Exploration of the Paleocene diatom record</b> (with the help of E. Drews and S. Böhne):<br/>
			Due to a scarcity of studies on Paleocene diatoms (outside of the Russian platform), little is known about the diversity and the abundance of the group during this period. I am thus trying to fill that gap by exploring the Paleocene material present in the MRC (<a href="https://iodp.tamu.edu/curation/mrc.html">Micropaleontological Reference Center</a>) collection, here in Berlin.
			</li>
			<li class="current"><b>A Revamp for CLAMP</b> (a collaboration with C. Coiffard, from the MfN)<br/>
			</li>
			<li class="current"><b>Monograph on Carpocaniidae</b>:<br/>
			This small group of Nasselarian radiolarians being often ignored by most researchers (often reduced to a "<em>Carpocanium</em> spp." mention), I am trying to revise its alpha taxonomy, understand its Bauplan, the limits of the group and its relationship with Artostrobiidae and Cannobotryidae, as well as document its biogeography and stratigraphy, through a systematic exploration of the material present in Berlin's <a href="https://iodp.tamu.edu/curation/mrc.html">MRC</a> collection.
