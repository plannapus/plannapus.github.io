		A (very) short word on my current projects:
		<ul class="current">
			<li class="current"><b>Diatoms, radiolarians and the Cenozoic carbon and silicon cycles (DFG RE3470/3-1)</b>:<br/>
			The goal of this project is to estimate the mass of siliceous microfossils that deposited since the middle Eocene in the world's sediments, in order to constrain the Cenozoic fluctuations in the volume of the marine silicon cycle, and to test quantitatively the hypothesis according to which the Cenozoic expansion of diatoms impacted the global carbon cycle on a geological timescale.
			</li>
			<li class="current"><b>nsb_adp_wx.py and NSB age model quality</b>:<br/>
			As a companion to the <a href="http://nsb-mfn-berlin.de">Neptune database (NSB)</a>, we are developing a <a href="https://github.com/plannapus/nsb_adp_wx">software</a> allowing the user to check the database's age models and how they were built, to modify them, to create new ones, etc.<br/><br/>
			<div><img class="current" src="static/nsb_adp.png" alt="Screenshot of the software in use" width="800"><p class="caption">Screenshot of nsb_adp_wx in use.</p></div>
			We are currently in the process of testing the quality of the age models in NSB: <a href="https://github.com/plannapus/nsb_adp_wx">nsb_adp_wx</a> is already an invaluable tool for us to explore alternative age models to replace those of poor quality.
			</li>
			<li class="current"><b>Testing the vital effect in silicon isotopes measured on Late Eocene radiolarians</b> (a collaboration with G. Fontorbe, P. Frings and D. Conley from the University of Lund).<br/>
			</li>
			<li class="current"><b>Exploration of the Paleocene diatom record</b>:<br/>
			Due to a scarcity of studies on Paleocene diatoms (outside of the Russian platform), little is known about the diversity and the abundance of the group during this period. I am thus trying to fill that gap by exploring the Paleocene material present in the MRC (<a href="https://iodp.tamu.edu/curation/mrc.html">Micropaleontological Reference Center</a>) collection, here in Berlin.
			</li>
			<li class="current"><b>A Revamp for CLAMP</b> (a collaboration with C. Coiffard, from the MfN)<br/>
			</li>
			<li class="current"><b>Monograph on Carpocaniidae</b>:<br/>
			This small group of Nasselarian radiolarians being often ignored by most researchers (often reduced to a "<em>Carpocanium</em> spp." mention), I am trying to revise its alpha taxonomy, understand its Bauplan, the limits of the group and its relationship with Artostrobiidae and Cannobotryidae, as well as document its biogeography and stratigraphy, through a systematic exploration of the material present in Berlin's <a href="https://iodp.tamu.edu/curation/mrc.html">MRC</a> collection.
