abstract = {ABSTRACT Turtles have high shape variation of their mandibles, likely reflecting adaptations to a broad variety of food items and ingestion strategies. Here, we compare functional disparity measured by biomechanical proxies and character disparity measured by discrete morphological characters. Functional and character disparities vary between clades and ecological groups and are thus decoupled. Comparisons with cranial disparity also indicate decoupled patterns within the turtle skull. Exploration of mandibular patterns reveals that several biomechanical configurations or character state combinations can lead to the same feeding type (i.e., convergence) or that high functional disparity can be achieved at a low exhaustion of character state combinations (e.g., cryptodires). Dietary specialists show larger functional disparity than generalists, but the phylogenetically widespread generalist ecology leads to high character disparity signals in the ecotype. Whereas character disparity generally shows high phylogenetic signal, functional disparity patterns correspond to dietary specializations, which may occur convergently across different groups. Despite this, individual functional measurements have overlapping ranges across ecogroups and do not always conform to biomechanical expectations. Jaw opening and closing biomechanical advantages model trade-offs between force transmission and opening/closing speeds, and turtles show a variety of combinations of values that we try to synthesize into several “jaw types”. Closing mechanical advantage shows that turtles retain high levels of force transmission at the anterior jaw end compared with other groups (e.g., pseudosuchians). This can possibly be explained as an evolutionary adaptation to retain high bite forces at small head sizes.},

	abstract = {Since Ernst Haeckel and the Challenger expedition (1872-1876), Radiolaria have been known as ubiquitous and abundant star-shaped oceanic plankton. Their exquisite biomineralized skeletons have left an extensive fossil record which is extremely valuable for biostratigraphic and paleo-environmental research. In contemporary oceans, there is growing evidence that Radiolaria are significant contributors to marine food webs and global biogeochemical cycles. Here we provide a comprehensive morpho-molecular framework to assess the extant diversity, biogeography and evolutionary history of Radiolaria. Our analyses reveal that half of radiolarian diversity is morphologically undescribed, with a large part forming three hyper-diverse environmental clades, named Rad-A, Rad-B and Rad-C. We suggest that most of this undescribed diversity likely comprises skeleton-less life forms or endosymbionts, explaining their elusive nature. Phylogenetic analyses highlight the need for major revision of high-level Radiolaria taxonomy, including placement of the Collodaria within the order Nassellaria. Fossil calibration of a molecular clock revealed the first appearance of Radiolaria \~{}760 million years ago (Ma), the development of the skeleton in the early Paleozoic (\~{}500 Ma) and the onset of photosymbiotic relationships during the mid to late Mesozoic (\~{}140 Ma), related to geological periods of oligotrophy and anoxia. The results presented here provide an extensive and robust framework for developing new perspectives on early eukaryotic diversification, paleo-environmental impacts on plankton evolution, and marine microbial ecology in rapidly evolving ecosystems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Abstract Siliceous marine ecosystems play a critical role in shaping the Earth's climate system by influencing rates of organic carbon burial and marine authigenic clay formation (i.e., reverse weathering). The ecological demise of silicifying organisms associated with the Permian-Triassic mass extinction is postulated to have elevated marine authigenic clay formation rates, resulting in a prolonged greenhouse climate during the Early Triassic. Yet, our understanding of the response of siliceous marine organisms during this critical interval is poor. Whilst radiolarians experienced the strongest diversity loss in their evolutionary history and perhaps also the greatest population decline of silica-secreting organisms during this event, only a small number of Griesbachian (post-extinction) localities that record siliceous organisms are known. Here, we report newly discovered latest Changhsingian to early Griesbachian (Clarkina meishanensis - Hindeodus parvus Zone) radiolarians and siliceous sponge spicules from Svalbard. This fauna documents the survival of a low-diversity radiolarian assemblage alongside stem-group hexactinellid sponges making this the first described account of post-extinction silica-secreting organisms from the Permian/Triassic boundary in a shallow marine shelf environment and a mid-northern paleolatitudinal setting. Our findings indicate that latitudinal diversity gradients for silica-secreting organisms following the mass extinction were significantly altered, and that silica productivity was restricted to high latitude and deep water thermal refugia. This result has potential to further shape our understanding of changes in marine dissolved silica levels and in turn rates of reverse weathering, with implications for our understanding of carbon cycle dynamics during this interval.},

	abstract = {Abstract Motivation We have little understanding of how communities respond to varying magnitudes and rates of environmental perturbations across temporal scales. BioDeepTime harmonizes assemblage time series of presence and abundance data to help facilitate investigations of community dynamics across timescales and the response of communities to natural and anthropogenic stressors. BioDeepTime includes time series of terrestrial and aquatic assemblages of varying spatial and temporal grain and extent from the present-day to millions of years ago. Main Types of Variables Included BioDeepTime currently contains 7,437,847 taxon records from 10,062 assemblage time series, each with a minimum of 10 time steps. Age constraints, sampling method, environment and taxonomic scope are provided for each time series. Spatial Location and Grain The database includes 8752 unique sampling locations from freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Spatial grain represented by individual samples varies from quadrats on the order of several cm2 to grid cells of ~100\,km2. Time Period and Grain BioDeepTime in aggregate currently spans the last 451\,million years, with the 10,062 modern and fossil assemblage time series ranging in extent from years to millions of years. The median extent of modern time series is 18.7\,years and for fossil series is 54,872\,years. Temporal grain, the time encompassed by individual samples, ranges from days to tens of thousands of years. Major Taxa and Level of Measurement The database contains information on 28,777 unique taxa with 4,769,789 records at the species level and another 271,218 records known to the genus level, including time series of benthic and planktonic foraminifera, coccolithophores, diatoms, ostracods, plants (pollen), radiolarians and other invertebrates and vertebrates.

@article{Trubovitz:2023aa,
	abstract = {A major premise of ecological neutral theory is that population size is inversely related to extinction risk. This idea is central to modern biodiversity conservation efforts, which often rely on abundance metrics to partially determine species extinction risk. However, limited empirical studies have tested whether extinction is indeed more probable for species with low abundances. Here we use the fossil record of Neogene radiolaria to test the relationship between relative abundance and longevity (time from first to last occurrence). Our dataset includes abundance histories for 189 polycystine radiolarian species from the Southern Ocean, and 101 species from the tropical Pacific. Using linear regression analyses, we show that neither maximum nor average relative abundance are significant predictors of longevity in either oceanographic region. This suggests that neutral theory fails to explain the plankton ecological-evolutionary dynamics we observe. Extrinsic factors are likely more important than neutral dynamics in controlling radiolarian extinction.},

	abstract = {Ongoing climate change is predicted to trigger major shifts in the geographic distribution of marine plankton species. However, it remains unclear whether species will successfully track optimal habitats to new regions, or face extinction. Here we show that one significant zooplankton group, the radiolaria, underwent a severe decline in high latitude species richness presaged by ecologic reorganization during the late Neogene, a time of amplified polar cooling. We find that the majority (71{\%}) of affected species did not relocate to the warmer low latitudes, but went extinct. This indicates that some plankton species cannot track optimal temperatures on a global scale as assumed by ecologic models; instead, assemblages undergo restructuring and extinction once local environmental thresholds are exceeded. This pattern forewarns profound diversity loss of high latitude radiolaria in the near future, which may have cascading effects on the ocean food web and carbon cycle.},

Expeditions to sample these sediments have produced large amounts of spatiotemporal occurrence records throughout the Cenozoic, but no single source exists to house these data. We have therefore created a comprehensive dataset that integrates numerous sources for spatiotemporal records of planktonic foraminifera. This new dataset, Triton, contains >500,000 records and is four times larger than the previous largest database, Neptune. To ensure comparability among data sources, we have cleaned all records using a unified set of taxonomic concepts and have converted age data to the GTS 2020 timescale. Where ages were not absolute (e.g. based on biostratigraphic or magnetostratigraphic zones), we have used generalised additive models to produce continuous estimates. This dataset is an excellent resource for macroecological and macroevolutionary studies, particularly for investigating how species responded to past climatic changes.},

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 379 recovered continuous late Miocene to Holocene sediments from a sediment drift on the continental rise, allowing assessment of sedimentation processes in response to climate cycles and trends since the late Miocene. Via seismic correlation to the shelf, we interpret massive prograding sequences that extended the outer shelf by 80 km during the Pliocene through frequent advances of grounded ice. Buried grounding zone wedges indicate prolonged periods of ice-sheet retreat, or even collapse, during an extended mid-Pliocene warm period from ∼4.2‒3.2 Ma inferred from Expedition 379 records. These results indicate that the WAIS was highly dynamic during the Pliocene and major retreat events may have occurred along the Amundsen Sea margin.},
