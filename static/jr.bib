	Abstract = {<p>Marine planktonic diatoms export carbon to the deep ocean, playing a key role in the global carbon cycle. Although commonly thought to have diversified over the Cenozoic as global oceans cooled, only two conflicting quantitative reconstructions exist, both from the Neptune deep-sea microfossil occurrences database. Total diversity shows Cenozoic increase but is sample size biased; conventional subsampling shows little net change. We calculate diversity from a separately compiled new diatom species range catalog, and recalculate Neptune subsampled-in-bin diversity using new methods to correct for increasing Cenozoic geographic endemism and decreasing Cenozoic evenness. We find coherent, substantial Cenozoic diversification in both datasets. Many living cold water species, including species important for export productivity, originate only in the latest Miocene or younger. We make a first quantitative comparison of diatom diversity to the global Cenozoic benthic ∂<sup>18</sup>O (climate) and carbon cycle records (∂<sup>13</sup>C, and 20-0 Ma pCO<sub>2</sub>). Warmer climates are strongly correlated with lower diatom diversity (raw: rho = .92, p&lt;.001; detrended, r = .6, p = .01). Diatoms were 20% less diverse in the early late Miocene, when temperatures and pCO<sub>2</sub> were only moderately higher than today. Diversity is strongly correlated to both ∂<sup>13</sup>C and pCO<sub>2</sub> over the last 15 my (for both: r&gt;.9, detrended r&gt;.6, all p&lt;.001), but only weakly over the earlier Cenozoic, suggesting increasingly strong linkage of diatom and climate evolution in the Neogene. Our results suggest that many living marine planktonic diatom species may be at risk of extinction in future warm oceans, with an unknown but potentially substantial negative impact on the ocean biologic pump and oceanic carbon sequestration. We cannot however extrapolate our my-scale correlations with generic climate proxies to anthropogenic time-scales of warming without additional species-specific information on proximate ecologic controls.</p>},

	Abstract = {
Acquiring data on the occurrences of many types of difficult to identify objects are often still made by human observation, for example, in biodiversity and paleontologic research. Existing computer counting programs used to record such data have various limitations, including inflexibility and cost. We describe a new open-source program for this purpose---Raritas. Raritas is written in Python and can be run as a standalone app for recent versions of either MacOS or Windows, or from the command line as easily customized source code. The program explicitly supports a rare category count mode which makes it easier to collect quantitative data on rare categories, for example, rare species which are important in biodiversity surveys. Lastly, we describe the file format used by Raritas and propose it as a standard for storing geologic biodiversity data. `Stratigraphic occurrence data' file format combines extensive sample metadata and a flexible structure for recording occurrence data of species or other categories in a series of samples.

	Abstract = {The Middle Eocene diatom and silicoflagellate record of ODP Site 1260A (Demerara Rise) is studied quantitatively in order to throw light on the changes that siliceous phytoplankton communities experienced during a Middle Eocene warming event that occurred between 44.0 and 42.0&#xa0;Ma. Both Pianka's overlap index, calculated per couple of successive samples, and cluster analysis, point to a number of significant turnover events highlighted by changes in the structure of floristic communities. The pre-warming flora, dominated by cosmopolitan species of the diatom genus Triceratium, is replaced during the warming interval by a new and more diverse assemblage, dominated by Paralia sulcata (an indicator of high productivity) and two endemic tropical species of the genus Hemiaulus. The critical warming interval is characterized by a steady increase in biogenic silica and a comparable increase in excess Ba, both reflecting an increase in productivity. In general, it appears that high productivity not only increased the flux of biogenic silica, but also sustained a higher diversity in the siliceous phytoplankton communities. The microflora preserved above the critical interval is once again of low diversity and dominated by various species of the diatom genus Hemiaulus. All assemblages in the studied material are characterized by the total absence of continental and benthic diatoms and the relative abundance of neritic forms, suggesting a transitional depositional environment between the neritic and the oceanic realms.},

@article{Wiese01122016,
	Abstract = {Correlations between past biotic diversity and climate can inform humanity's response to predictions of future global climate change, e.g., extinction risk with global warming. Paleodiversity studies, however, frequently use genera as a proxy for species diversity, a practice that has often been questioned. Tests using actual data of the impact of using species-level versus genus-level taxonomy in paleodiversity-paleoenvironmental studies are also lacking. We conduct such a test, based on a recent study that showed a strong correlation of Cenozoic marine planktonic diatom species diversity to geochemical climate proxies. Using an updated version of the data set, we still find a strong correlation of Cenozoic diatom species diversity to environment. Using identical data but instead genera results in the loss of all significant correlations of diversity to environmental change. This occurs due to the earlier rise and later stability in genus versus species diversity data, a pattern known to be common between taxonomic ranks in the fossil record, and in general models of diversification. We conclude that studies of paleodiversity, particularly those addressing biotic responses to future environmental change, need to demonstrate the adequacy of genera as a proxy for species diversity, or use species-level data.},
